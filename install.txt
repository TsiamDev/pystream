To get PyStream running, you must do the following:


=== Dependencies ===

* Install Python 2.6.

* Install Graphviz, and make sure it works.
(I've encountered a case where a .rpm install did not work correctly out of the box.)


=== Native Code ===

* If you're not using windows, run ./native/_pystream/setup.py and then copy the resulting _pystream.pyd into ./bin directory.
